## Report 
1. Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction vs Education (Top Left):
This graph shows the relationship between salary ranges, job satisfaction, and education levels. Each salary slab is represented by a cluster of bars, with different colors likely indicating education levels. Job satisfaction seems to vary across salary ranges and education levels, without a clear linear trend. The highest job satisfaction appears in the "Upto 5k" salary range for one education level. There's considerable variation within each salary slab, suggesting that factors beyond salary influence job satisfaction.

2. Education vs Job Satisfaction (Top Right):
This line graph depicts how job satisfaction changes with education level. The relationship is non-linear, with peaks at education levels 1 and 4, and a notable dip at level 3. This suggests that both lower and higher education levels are associated with higher job satisfaction, while mid-level education shows lower satisfaction. The overall trend is slightly downward, implying that higher education doesn't necessarily correlate with increased job satisfaction.

3. Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction (Bottom Left):
This line graph shows the average job satisfaction for each salary range. Interestingly, job satisfaction peaks in the "5k-10k" range and then declines for higher salary ranges. This counterintuitive result suggests that higher salaries don't always lead to greater job satisfaction. Factors such as job stress, work-life balance, or expectations might play a role in this trend.

4. Education vs Salary Slab (Bottom Right):
This graph illustrates how salary levels change with education. The y-axis seems to be fixed at the "5k-10k" salary range, which limits the interpretation. However, the downward trend of the line suggests that as education level increases, the likelihood of being in the "5k-10k" salary range decreases. This implies that higher education is generally associated with higher salary ranges, though the full picture isn't visible due to the limited y-axis.
