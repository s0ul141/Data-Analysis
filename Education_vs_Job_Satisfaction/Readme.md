[1] In this picture we have four differemt Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction vs Education (Top Left), Education vs Job Satisfaction (Top Right), Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction (Bottom Left) and  Education vs Salary Slab (Bottom Right) which are described below in details.
1. Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction vs Education (Top Left):
This graph shows the relationship between salary ranges, job satisfaction, and education levels. Each salary slab is represented by a cluster of bars, with different colors likely indicating education levels. Job satisfaction seems to vary across salary ranges and education levels, without a clear linear trend. The highest job satisfaction appears in the "Upto 5k" salary range for one education level. There's considerable variation within each salary slab, suggesting that factors beyond salary influence job satisfaction.

2. Education vs Job Satisfaction (Top Right):
This line graph depicts how job satisfaction changes with education level. The relationship is non-linear, with peaks at education levels 1 and 4, and a notable dip at level 3. This suggests that both lower and higher education levels are associated with higher job satisfaction, while mid-level education shows lower satisfaction. The overall trend is slightly downward, implying that higher education doesn't necessarily correlate with increased job satisfaction.

4. Salary Slab vs Job Satisfaction (Bottom Left):
This line graph shows the average job satisfaction for each salary range. Interestingly, job satisfaction peaks in the "5k-10k" range and then declines for higher salary ranges. This counterintuitive result suggests that higher salaries don't always lead to greater job satisfaction. Factors such as job stress, work-life balance, or expectations might play a role in this trend.

5. Education vs Salary Slab (Bottom Right):
This graph illustrates how salary levels change with education. The y-axis seems to be fixed at the "5k-10k" salary range, which limits the interpretation. However, the downward trend of the line suggests that as education level increases, the likelihood of being in the "5k-10k" salary range decreases. This implies that higher education is generally associated with higher salary ranges, though the full picture isn't visible due to the limited y-axis.

[2] This graph depicts job satisfaction across different education fields, comparing males and females. Here's an analysis of the key points:

1. Overall trends:
   - Job satisfaction varies across education fields for both genders.
   - In most fields, the satisfaction levels are relatively similar between males and females.

2. Field-specific observations:
   - Life Sciences and Marketing show nearly identical satisfaction levels for both genders.
   - Medical field has higher satisfaction for males compared to females.
   - Technical Degree and "Other" categories show slightly higher satisfaction for males.
   - Human Resources is the only field where females report notably higher satisfaction than males.

3. Gender differences:
   - The most significant gender gap is in Human Resources, favoring females.
   - The Medical field shows the largest gap favoring males.
   - Other fields show smaller differences between genders.

4. Satisfaction levels:
   - Most fields have satisfaction levels between 3.0 and 4.0 for both genders.
   - No field shows extremely low satisfaction (below 2.0) for either gender.

5. Data representation:
   - The use of box plots suggests there's variability in satisfaction within each group, though the exact spread isn't clear from this visualization.
   - The median (horizontal line in each bar) provides a good comparison point between groups.

6. Implications:
   - The data challenges simplistic narratives about gender satisfaction in different fields.
   - It suggests that factors beyond gender play significant roles in job satisfaction within education fields.
   - The Human Resources field might have qualities that particularly appeal to or benefit female workers.

Overall, this graph provides a nuanced view of job satisfaction across education fields and genders, highlighting both similarities and differences. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors when analyzing job satisfaction in various professional domains.

[3] Correlation Matrix:
1. Strong positive correlations:
   - Monthly Income and Job Level (0.95)
   - SS (likely Salary Satisfaction) and Monthly Income (0.96)
   - SS and Job Level (0.91)
   - Years at Company and Years in Current Role (0.76)

2. Moderate positive correlations:
   - Age and Monthly Income (0.50)
   - Age and Job Level (0.51)
   - Years at Company and Job Level (0.54)

3. Weak or no correlations:
   - Job Satisfaction shows very weak or no correlation with most other factors, which is surprising
   - Education has weak positive correlations with most factors
   - Performance Rating has weak or no correlations with other factors

4. Interesting observations:
   - Age correlates positively with Monthly Income, Job Level, and Years at Company, as expected
   - Education doesn't strongly correlate with income or job level, which is somewhat unexpected
   - Job Involvement doesn't show strong correlations with other factors

5. Potential insights:
   - Career progression (Job Level, Monthly Income, SS) seems more tied to tenure and age than to education or performance ratings
   - Job satisfaction appears to be independent of most other factors, suggesting it's influenced by unmeasured variables

This correlation matrix provides valuable insights into the relationships between various job-related factors, highlighting the complex nature of career progression and job satisfaction. It suggests that traditional metrics like salary and job level are closely related.

[4] This graph displays the relationship between job satisfaction, education level, and education field. Here's an analysis:

1. Overall trends:
   - Job satisfaction varies across education levels and fields.
   - There's no clear linear trend between education level and job satisfaction for most fields.

2. Education levels:
   - Ranges from 1 to 5, likely representing different degree levels (e.g., high school, bachelor's, master's, etc.).
   - The impact of education level on job satisfaction differs by field.

3. Education fields:
   - Six fields are represented: Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing, Technical Degree, Other, and Human Resources.
   - Each field shows different patterns across education levels.

4. Field-specific observations:
   - Life Sciences: Relatively stable satisfaction across education levels.
   - Medical: Highest satisfaction at level 2, lowest at level 5.
   - Marketing: Fairly consistent across levels, slight peak at level 4.
   - Technical Degree: Increases with education level, peaks at level 5.
   - Other: Varies considerably, highest at level 1.
   - Human Resources: Highly variable, peaks at level 1, lowest at level 5.

5. Variability:
   - Error bars indicate significant variability within each category.
   - Some fields (e.g., Human Resources) show more variability than others.

6. Highest satisfaction:
   - Technical Degree at education level 5 shows the highest overall satisfaction.
   - Human Resources at level 1 also shows very high satisfaction.

7. Lowest satisfaction:
   - Human Resources at level 5 shows the lowest satisfaction.
   - Medical field at level 5 also shows relatively low satisfaction.

8. Implications:
   - The relationship between education and job satisfaction is complex and field-dependent.
   - Higher education doesn't always correlate with higher job satisfaction.
   - Some fields may benefit more from advanced education than others in terms of job satisfaction.

This graph highlights the complexity of job satisfaction and its relationship to education. It suggests that career guidance and educational decisions should consider field-specific trends rather than assuming a universal benefit to higher education levels.

[5] In this image we have four graphs comparing various career-related factors across age groups and genders. Here's an analysis of each graph:

1. Age vs Job Level:
- Job level increases with age for both genders.
- Males have slightly higher job levels in younger age groups (18-45).
- Females catch up and slightly surpass males in job level for the 55+ age group.
- The peak job level is reached in the 46-55 age group for both genders.

2. Age vs Monthly Income:
- Income generally increases with age for both genders.
- Males have higher incomes across all age groups, with the gap widening in middle age (36-55).
- The income peak is in the 46-55 age group for both genders.
- There's a slight decrease in income for the 55+ group, more pronounced for males.

3. Age vs Years At Company:
- Years at the company naturally increase with age.
- The trend is similar for both genders, with females showing slightly higher tenure in older age groups.
- The 46-55 age group shows the highest average years at the company.
- There's a slight decrease in tenure for the 55+ group, possibly due to retirement or career changes.

4. Age vs Years In Current Role:
- Years in the current role generally increase with age.
- Females tend to have slightly more years in their current role across most age groups.
- The increase is less steep compared to overall company tenure, suggesting role changes within the company.
- The 55+ group shows high variability, with some staying in roles longer while others might transition to new roles.

General observations:
- There's a consistent pattern of career progression with age for both genders.
- Gender disparities are most noticeable in income, with males generally earning more.
- Job levels and company tenure show more equality between genders, especially in later career stages.
- The 46-55 age group often represents the peak for various career metrics.
- The 55+ group shows more variability and some declines, possibly reflecting diverse late-career paths.

These graphs provide insights into career trajectories and gender differences across different age groups, highlighting both progress in gender equality and areas where disparities persist, especially in income.
![PIC_6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4864b6a2-1260-47ba-94e9-9bdeec1359f8)
[6] This is a graph, which is depicting the relationship between age, job level, and monthly income. Here are the key observations:

1. Job Levels: The graph shows 5 job levels, ranging from 1 to 5.

2. Age Groups: There are 5 age groups represented: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 55+.

3. Income Trend: Generally, monthly income increases with job level across all age groups.

4. Age Impact: Within each job level, there are some variations in income based on age, but the differences are not consistent across all levels.

5. Entry Level (1): Shows the smallest income differences between age groups, with a slight upward trend as age increases.

6. Mid Levels (2-3): Display more variation between age groups, with middle age ranges often earning slightly more.

7. Upper Levels (4-5): Show the most significant income differences. At level 5, the older age groups tend to earn more.

8. Highest Incomes: Are seen at job level 5, particularly for the 36+ age groups.

9. Youngest Group (18-25): Consistently has lower incomes across job levels 1-2, and is absent from levels 3-5.

10. Oldest Group (55+): Shows varied performance, sometimes earning the most (level 5) and sometimes less than younger groups (level 4).

This graph illustrates how both job level and age can influence monthly income, with job level appearing to have a stronger overall impact on earnings.
![PIC_7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d55583b7-45ee-4898-a701-dd398db8cd4d)

[7] This graph shows the relationship between an employee's age, years at the company, and years in their current role.

The x-axis represents "Years At Company" ranging from 0 to 40 years. The y-axis shows "Years in Current Role" up to about 16 years. Different age groups are represented by color-coded bars:

- 18-25 (blue)
- 26-35 (teal)
- 36-45 (light green)
- 46-55 (beige)
- 55+ (orange)

Key observations:
1. Younger employees (blue and teal) are more prevalent in the early years at the company.
2. As years at the company increase, we see more representation from older age groups.
3. There's a general trend of increasing years in current role as years at the company increase, though it's not a perfect correlation.
4. The graph shows data points up to 40 years at the company, with some employees in the 55+ category having the longest tenures.
5. There's considerable variation in years in current role across all age groups and company tenures.
This visualization helps understand employee retention, promotion patterns, and how age relates to company and role tenure.

![PIC_8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7b77b50-90a3-4685-802d-b3f71e21a369)

[8] This graph illustrates the relationship between job levels and monthly income. Here are the key points:

1. The x-axis represents job levels from 1 to 5, likely indicating increasing seniority or responsibility.

2. The y-axis shows monthly income, ranging from 0 to 20,000 (presumably in a given currency).

3. There's a clear positive correlation between job level and monthly income:
   - Level 1: Approximately 2,500 per month
   - Level 2: Around 5,500 per month
   - Level 3: About 10,000 per month
   - Level 4: Roughly 15,500 per month
   - Level 5: Nearly 20,000 per month

4. The increase in income is relatively consistent between levels, with each step up representing about a 5,000 increase in monthly income.

5. The color gradient of the bars darkens as the job level increases, visually reinforcing the progression.

This graph effectively demonstrates how income typically scales with job level within this organization or industry, showing a clear financial incentive for career advancement.
![PIC_9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd2cfe3-6eb5-4647-b167-437d752dcd13)
[9] These graphs illustrate the relationships between job levels and two different metrics: years at the company and years in the current role.

Top Graph - Job Level vs Years At Company:
1. Shows a clear positive correlation between job level and years at the company.
2. As job level increases from 1 to 5, the average years at the company steadily rises.
3. Level 1 employees average about 4 years at the company, while level 5 employees average around 15 years.
4. The increase is relatively consistent between levels, with each step up representing about 2-3 years more at the company.
5. Error bars indicate some variation within each level.

Bottom Graph - Job Level vs Years In Current Role:
1. Also shows a positive correlation, but less pronounced than the top graph.
2. Employees at level 1 have been in their current role for about 2.5 years on average.
3. There's a significant jump between levels 1 and 2, with level 2 employees averaging about 4.5 years in their current role.
4. The increase becomes more gradual for higher levels, with level 5 employees averaging about 6.5 years in their current role.
5. Error bars are larger for higher levels, suggesting more variation in time spent in roles at senior levels.

Overall, these graphs suggest that as employees progress to higher job levels, they tend to have spent more time both at the company and in their current roles. However, the increase in years at the company is more pronounced than the increase in years in the current role, implying that career progression often involves moving to new roles within the company.

![PIC_10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fadd2e92-9b54-4b87-8c93-a96943294527)
[10] This image shows a scatter plot comparing employees' years at a company, years in their current role, and job level within the organization.
The x-axis represents "Years At Company", ranging from 0 to 40 years. The y-axis shows "Years in Current Role", going up to 16 years. Each data point is color-coded to represent the employee's job level, with 5 levels indicated in the legend.
Key observations:
1. There's a general upward trend, suggesting that employees who have been with the company longer tend to have spent more time in their current roles.
2. Job levels appear somewhat correlated with company tenure, as higher-level positions (4 and 5) are more common among those with longer company tenures.
3. There's significant variation in years in current role across all job levels and years at the company, indicating diverse career paths within the organization.
4. The densest cluster of data points is in the 5-20 year range for company tenure and 2-10 year range for time in current role.
5. Some employees have been in their current roles for a very long time (up to 16 years), while others in similar tenure brackets have much less time in their current positions.
This visualization provides insights into employee retention, promotion patterns, and career progression within the company.

[11] This image contains four graphs showing relationships between years of experience, monthly income, and gender in a company:

1. Top-left: Bar chart of Monthly Income vs Years in Current Role, split by gender
- Generally shows increasing income with more years in role
- Some fluctuations, but overall upward trend
- Gender differences visible, with males often having higher income for same years in role

2. Top-right: Line graph of Monthly Income vs Years in Current Role
- Confirms overall upward trend of income with years in role
- Shows variability (wider shaded area) increasing for longer tenures

3. Bottom-left: Bar chart of Monthly Income vs Years at Company, split by gender
- Similar to top-left, but for total company tenure instead of current role
- Shows general increase in income with longer company tenure
- Gender differences again visible, with some exceptions

4. Bottom-right: Line graph of Monthly Income vs Years at Company
- Demonstrates overall increase in income with company tenure
- High variability for longer tenures
- Slight downward trend for very long tenures (35+ years)


Key observations:
- Income generally increases with both years in current role and total years at company
- Gender differences in income are present, often favoring males
- Income variability increases with longer tenures
- Some unexpected drops or plateaus in income for certain experience levels

These visualizations provide insights into salary progression, gender pay differences, and the relationship between experience and income in the company.

[12] ![PIC_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef70c363-695c-4065-b59d-e438fdc7dac0)

This plot shows the relationship between monthly income, years at a company, and years in the current role for employees. Here's a detailed description:

Title: "Monthly Income and Years At Company and Years In Current Role"

X-axis: "YearsAtCompany" - ranging from 0 to 40 years
Y-axis: "MonthlyIncome" - ranging from 0 to 20,000 (presumably in dollars or another currency unit)

The plot uses vertical bars to represent individual employees or data points. Each bar's height indicates the monthly income, while its position on the x-axis shows the number of years at the company. The color of each bar represents the number of years in the current role, as indicated by the legend on the left side. The color scale ranges from light pink (0 years) to dark purple (18 years in current role).

Key observations:
1. There's a general trend of increasing income with more years at the company.
2. The highest incomes tend to be associated with longer tenures at the company.
3. There's significant variation in income even among employees with similar years of experience.
4. Employees with more years in their current role (darker colors) are often, but not always, associated with higher incomes.
5. There are fewer data points for very long tenures (30+ years).

This visualization effectively combines three variables (income, company tenure, and role tenure) to provide insights into career progression and compensation within the organization.

[13] ![PIC_13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0337e79-3242-4a0b-8bbe-f2c32047593e)
This image contains two plots that visualize the relationship between years at a company and years in the current role.

1. Bar Chart (Top):
Title: "Bar chart for Years At Company and Years In Current Role"
X-axis: "YearsAtCompany" (0 to 40 years)
Y-axis: "YearsInCurrentRole" (0 to 12 years)

This chart shows colored bars representing the average years in current role for each year of company tenure. The bars are color-coded, transitioning from orange for fewer years at the company to pink for more years. The trend generally shows an increase in years in current role as years at the company increase, with some fluctuations.

2. Line Graph (Bottom):
Title: "Line Graph for Years At Company and Years In Current Role"
X-axis: "YearsAtCompany" (0 to 40 years)
Y-axis: "YearsInCurrentRole" (0 to 14 years)

This graph displays a blue line representing the average years in current role over years at the company. The shaded area around the line likely represents a confidence interval or range of values. The line shows an overall upward trend, indicating that on average, employees tend to stay in their current roles longer as their tenure with the company increases. However, there are fluctuations and plateaus in this trend, especially after about 15 years at the company.

Both visualizations effectively illustrate the relationship between company tenure and role tenure, showing that generally, the longer an employee stays with the company, the longer they tend to remain in their current role, though this relationship is not strictly linear and shows variability.


[14] ![PIC_14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7287787-5fa3-4186-bbc1-9655b5fc4a74)

This image shows a bar chart titled "Age and Education Field" that displays data on education fields across different age groups.

The x-axis represents age groups: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 55+.

The y-axis shows a scale labeled "EF_code" ranging from 0 to 6, likely representing some form of education field coding or count.

There are four categories of education fields represented by different colored bars:
1. Blue (unlabeled in the image, but likely represents a field not specified in the legend)
2. Teal - Medical
3. Light Green - Technical Degree
4. Orange - Human Resources

Key observations:
1. Technical Degree consistently has the highest representation across all age groups.
2. Medical field representation is relatively consistent across age groups.
3. Human Resources has the lowest representation in all age groups.
4. The unlabeled blue category (possibly representing another field) shows consistent but lower representation across age groups.
5. The distribution of education fields appears fairly similar across all age groups, suggesting little variation in field choice based on age.

This visualization allows for easy comparison of education field preferences or representation across different age demographics in the studied population.

Figure:\
"Impact of Education on Job Satisfaction, Compensation, and Performance Metrics"\
The figure consists of four graphs comparing different aspects of job satisfaction and performance against education levels. \
Here's a description of each graph:

1. Education vs Environment Satisfaction:
This graph shows a fluctuating relationship between education level and environment satisfaction. There's a peak for graduates (level 3) and a sharp decline for post-graduates and PhDs.

2. Education vs Job Satisfaction:
Job satisfaction appears to vary significantly across education levels. It starts high for Class 12 pass, drops for diploma holders, rises again for graduates, peaks for post-graduates, and then sharply declines for PhDs.

3. Education vs Monthly Rate:
This graph depicts the relationship between education and monthly salary. Interestingly, Class 12 pass holders have the highest monthly rate, followed by a sharp decline for diploma holders. The rate increases slightly for higher education levels but doesn't reach the initial peak.

4. Education vs Performance Rating:
Performance ratings show slight variations across education levels. There's a small decline from Class 12 pass to graduate level, then a slight increase for post-graduates and PhDs.

This set of graphs provides a comprehensive view of how different levels of education correlate with various aspects of job satisfaction and performance. It reveals some counterintuitive trends, particularly in monthly rates and satisfaction levels, which don't always increase with higher education levels.

Figure:\
"Comparison of Job Metrics Across Educational Fields"\
This figure contains four graphs comparing different job-related metrics across various education fields. Here's a description of each graph:

1. Education vs Job Involvement:
This graph shows fluctuating job involvement levels across different education fields. There's a notable peak for the Medical field (EF_code 4) and a low point for Marketing (EF_code 3).

2. Education vs Job Level:
Job level appears to peak for Marketing (EF_code 3) and then steadily declines for subsequent fields, with Technical Degree holders having the lowest job level.

3. Education vs Years At Company:
This graph depicts the average years employees spend at the company across different fields. Marketing professionals (EF_code 3) show the longest tenure, while those in the "Other" category (EF_code 5) have the shortest.

4. Education vs Years In Current Role:
Years in current role peak for Marketing (EF_code 3) and then generally decline, with a slight uptick for Technical Degree holders (EF_code 6).


These graphs provide insights into how different educational backgrounds relate to various aspects of employment, including job involvement, level, company tenure, and role duration. The data suggests that there are significant variations across different educational fields, with Marketing often standing out in terms of job level and tenure.

It's important to note that the x-axis (EF_code) represents different educational fields:
1: Human Resources
2: Life Sciences
3: Marketing
4: Medical
5: Other
6: Technical Degree

This visualization allows for a comprehensive comparison of how these different educational backgrounds correlate with various job-related metrics.

[17] ![PIC_18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eaaca5e-88b7-4e32-9d63-e2053fb3549a)\

This image contains two graphs illustrating the relationship between Education Field and Monthly Income:

1. Bar Chart for Education Field vs Monthly Income:
This graph shows monthly income across different education fields using blue bars. The x-axis represents the education field codes (EF_code) from 1 to 6, corresponding to Human Resources, Life Sciences, Marketing, Medical, Other, and Technical Degree respectively. The y-axis shows monthly income. The bars indicate that Marketing (EF_code 3) has the highest monthly income, followed closely by Human Resources (EF_code 1). Technical Degree holders (EF_code 6) appear to have the lowest monthly income.

2. Line Graph for Education Field vs Monthly Income:
This graph presents the same data as a line chart, allowing for a clearer visualization of the trends. It confirms the observations from the bar chart, showing a peak for Marketing (EF_code 3) and a general downward trend towards Technical Degree holders (EF_code 6). Human Resources (EF_code 1) starts high, there's a dip for Life Sciences (EF_code 2), then a sharp rise for Marketing, followed by a consistent decline across Medical, Other, and Technical Degree fields.

Key observations:
- Marketing professionals appear to earn the highest monthly income.
- There's a significant variation in income across different education fields.
- Technical Degree holders seem to earn the least among the given categories.
- The line graph shows more pronounced differences between fields compared to the bar chart.

This visualization provides insights into how different educational backgrounds correlate with monthly income in various professional fields.
